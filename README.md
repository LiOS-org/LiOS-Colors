# LiOS-Colors

## What is LiOS-Colors?

LiOS Colors is a fork of open source project **[meodai/color-names](https://github.com/meodai/color-names)** and is part of **[LiOS-Org](https://github.com/LiOS-org)**.

The main purpose of LiOS-Org is to provide a predefined **CSS** list of transluscent colors which can be utilized by importing the **CSS** and using variable **var(--x)**, where x is the hex code of a color without **"#"**

The list of supported colors can be found in **colornames.csv** or can be browsed **[Here](https://LiOS-Colors.web.app)**

## Contributions and PR

This project is not built with a purpose of accepting contributions that's why there are **no documentations, no automated build scripts and even the original build script has been modified**. 

If you want to add a new color, you are recommended to directly add it to upstream, LiOS-Colors automatically sources it and if you want to do any other changes you are still welcome and there are no restrictions.
